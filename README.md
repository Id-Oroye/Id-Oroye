👋 Hello. I am Oroye Idowu David.
 
👀 I have been passionate about computers and technology since a very young age and I recently began learning Frontend Web Development. I am currently a newbie and have been learning HTML, CSS and JS with considerable improvements.

💞️ I am currently interested in any tips and ideas that will help me become a better Frontend Web Developer, so any advice is really appreciated because I am self-studying.

📫 If you see my codes in here and want to give me some tips and advice on how I can get better; also, if you want us to collaborate on anything or discuss coding, I am available on Twitter @Id_Oroye. 

Thank you.
